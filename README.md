# Site Generator

The idea behind this proyect is generate the html for a 90's styled website that i'm creating in Zeronet, you can see it here:

http://127.0.0.1:43110/19NW5k68A3qRsomy42hLBZFsHbQ6kFg2yN/index.html

You need to have [Zeronet](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet) on you machine to be able to visit that site.

I want to do it in the lowest level possible, using only the language tools, without external libraries.

Initially i will use python to make the things a bit simpler.

The idea is to have partial content of the site (like header, footer, menu, each page content) maybe a site structure in a text file.

If im able to i will try to use semantic versioning with git tags and use that to generate the changelog
